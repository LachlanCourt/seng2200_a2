# SENG2200 - Programming Languages and Paradigms
## Assignment 2
### Task
Expand on the program in assignment 1 to implement generic types in the Linked List. Add two more kinds of PlanarShape, Circle and Semicircle, and implement these with custom area and originDistance calculations. The data should still be read from a text file however instead of creating the objects directly, a factory pattern should be used to allow for future expansion and ease of implementation. Using the area (And the origin distance if the area was not significantly different), the PlanarShapes should then be sorted using an insertion sort, and both the unsorted and sorted lists should be outputted using a specified format.
### Compile
`javac PA2.java`
### Run
`java PA2 <filename>`
